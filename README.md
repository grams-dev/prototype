# Grams Prototype Repository

Welcome to the Grams Prototype Repository, the starting point for the development of the Grams Web3 social media platform. This repository contains the foundational codebase to create a prototype using Vite, thirdweb, and Material-UI (MUI). Our goal is to leverage these cutting-edge technologies to build a user-friendly, secure, and interactive prototype that embodies the core functionalities of Grams.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Grams prototype, you will need to have Node.js installed on your system. This prototype assumes a basic understanding of React, TypeScript, and blockchain concepts facilitated by thirdweb.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- Git
- A code editor like VSCode

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/grams-prototype.git
cd grams-prototype
```

2. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Environment Setup**

Create a `.env` file at the root of your project and populate it with the necessary environment variables:

```plaintext
VITE_THIRDWEB_PROJECT_ID=your_thirdweb_project_id
VITE_MUI_THEME=your_preferred_mui_theme
```

Replace `your_thirdweb_project_id` with your actual Thirdweb project ID and `your_preferred_mui_theme` with the theme configuration for Material-UI.

4. **Run the Prototype**

```bash
npm start
```

This command runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

## Features

The Grams prototype integrates several key features to showcase the potential of a Web3 social media platform:

- **User Authentication:** Utilizes thirdweb's SDK for secure blockchain-based user authentication.
- **UI Components:** Employs Material-UI for a responsive, modern UI that enhances user experience.
- **Smart Contract Interaction:** Demonstrates basic interactions with smart contracts for posting, voting, and managing content.
